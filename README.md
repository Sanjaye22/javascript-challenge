## JavaScript-challenge

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 
All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 
* Create a basic HTML web page or use the StarterCode/index.html file provided 
* Use the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and 
then adds new rows of data for each UFO sightingCreate a table dynamically from the provided dataset - data.js
* Add a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input 

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 
All steps in Level 1 were completed. Level 2 is a continuation of Level 1 allowing for:

*  Multiple 'input tags and/or select dropdowns - using JavaScript code, the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based
on the table columns:
 - date/time
 - city
 - state
 - country
 - shape
